# OpenStax Calculus 1 Ancillary Materials

As a result of an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) Textbook Transformation Grant, we created a series of guided notes, with curated and specially created videos for use with the [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) [Calculus 1 textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1). The [guided notes](https://github.com/jd-roberts/OpenStaxCalc/tree/main/GuidedNotes) contain summaries of the main points of the chapters, extra worked problems, practice problems and embedded links to YouTube examples of each problem type. For instructor answer keys, see the note below.

## Homework
We used the low-cost homework system [Edfinity](edfinity.com). Edfinity courses are mapped to specific OER textbooks, and all problems are algorithmic and coded in an open-source problem format. The link to Edfinity's OpenStax Calculus 1 course is [here](https://edfinity.com/products/5c533d7d78811e0e5904234d).
